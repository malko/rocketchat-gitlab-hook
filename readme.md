This repository only contains a single  rocket chat integration script.

# Important note:
I'm not using rocket chat anymore but still maintain this repository, even if I can have a long delay to merge PRs.
If you are an active rocket chat user and want to take over with the project contact me directly at jgotti at jgotti dot org.
Anyway You can still propose PR i'll review them even if it can take me some times but please:
- make sure it works with recent versions
- respect the coding style of the project
